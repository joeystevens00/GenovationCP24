Executing commands when working in multiple machines/OSes  
- Output to Clipboard and "print" with CTRL+V. E.g. `perl -e "use Clipboard; Clipboard->copy(time);"`  
- If going back and forth between linux/windows then change the Run Command shortcut to META+R on linux   
- Longer scripts should be in path on all systems
